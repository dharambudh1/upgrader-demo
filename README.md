# Upgrader Demo

## Description:
The upgrader package requires the presence of a published app on either the Google Play Store or the Apple App Store. This package serves the purpose of verifying the availability of app updates, with the determination based on the app's distinctive identifier. On Apple devices, this identifier is referred to as the "Bundle identifier," while on Android devices, it is known as the "Package name." For the purposes of this demonstration app, I am utilizing the unique identifier associated with `Roblox` since, at present, I do not possess an active developer account.

- The Bundle identifier: `com.roblox.robloxmobile`
- The Package name: `com.roblox.client`

With the implementation of this technique, the upgrader package now perceives this demo app as a genuine `Roblox` application.

- Current version: `1.0.0`
- Latest version: `2.594.524` on iOS & `2.597.662` on Android
